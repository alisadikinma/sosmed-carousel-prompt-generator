## 2. Universal Carousel Structure (All Platforms)

### The HOOK → VALUE → CTA Framework

```
Slide 1: HOOK — Stop the scroll (curiosity gap, bold claim, shocking stat)
Slide 2: CONTEXT — Set up the problem or promise
Slide 3-N: VALUE — Deliver the content (tips, steps, data, insights)
Slide N+1: CTA — Tell them what to do next
```

### Slide Sequence Psychology

| Slide | Purpose | Engagement Trigger |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 (Hook) | Stop scrolling | Curiosity gap, pattern interrupt |
| 2 (Setup) | Create investment | Problem identification, "this is for you" |
| 3-7 (Value) | Deliver dopamine hits | One idea per slide, progressive reveal |
| 8-9 (Peak) | Strongest content | Most shareable insight, "save this" moment |
| Last (CTA) | Convert attention | Follow, save, share, comment, link |

### The "One Idea Per Slide" Rule
- Each slide = ONE concept, ONE visual, ONE takeaway
- If you need a paragraph, it's too much — split into 2 slides
- White space is your friend — don't crowd the frame
- Bold the KEY WORD in each slide (accent color highlight)

## 3. Instagram Carousel Best Practices

### Algorithm Signals
- **Saves** are the #1 ranking signal for carousels (more than likes)
- **Shares** are #2 — design for "tag a friend who needs this"
- **Dwell time** matters — more slides = more time on post = better reach
- **Completion rate** — Instagram tracks how many slides people swipe through
- **Re-visits** — carousels that people come back to get boosted

### Design Rules
| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| First slide = no text-heavy design | Feed preview must be visually striking |
| Use 4:5 aspect ratio for feed carousels | Takes up more screen real estate than 1:1 |
| Consistent color palette across all slides | Brand recognition + professional look |
| "SWIPE →" indicator on all slides except CTA | Increases swipe-through rate by 20-30% |
| Number your slides ("3/8") | Creates completion drive |
| Last slide = face + CTA | Personal connection converts |

### Content Types That Perform Best
1. **Educational listicles** — "7 Tools That Changed My Life"
2. **Before/After** — Transformation stories
3. **Step-by-step tutorials** — Process breakdowns
4. **Myth vs Reality** — Contrarian takes
5. **Data storytelling** — Stats with visual context
6. **Mini case studies** — Real results, real numbers

### Caption Strategy
- First line = hook (matches slide 1 hook)
- Body = expand on carousel content (not repeat it)
- End with question or micro-CTA
- 5 hashtags max (in caption, not comments) — Instagram algorithm penalizes >5 since Dec 2025
- Tag relevant accounts for reach

### Posting Cadence
- 3-5 carousels per week for growth phase
- Best times: 7-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 7-9 PM (local timezone)
- Tuesday-Thursday highest engagement
- Avoid posting within 2 hours of a previous post

## 4. TikTok Carousel Best Practices

### Algorithm Signals
- **Swipe completion rate** — most important metric
- **Saves** — indicates high-value content
- **Shares** — virality signal
- **Comments** — engagement depth
- **Time spent** — TikTok prioritizes content people linger on

### Design Rules
| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| 9:16 ONLY — no exceptions | Native format, full-screen experience |
| Bold text, large font (min 60px) | Readability on mobile |
| High contrast colors | Stands out in fast-scrolling feed |
| First slide = thumbnail in For You Page | Must compete with video thumbnails |
| Keep slides to 5-8 | TikTok audience has shorter attention span |
| Use trending sounds/music | Algorithm boost from audio signals |

### Content Types That Perform Best
1. **"POV" stories** — Relatable scenarios with photo narrative
2. **Ranking/Tier lists** — Opinionated takes spark comments
3. **Photo dumps with narrative** — Aesthetic + storytelling
4. **Quick tips** — Bite-sized education
5. **"Things I wish I knew"** — Wisdom format
6. **Controversial takes** — Engagement bait (use carefully)

### TikTok-Specific Features
- Add music/sound to carousel — increases reach significantly
- Use text-to-speech on key slides
- Enable comments — engagement signals
- Pin top comment as extended CTA
- Cross-post to Instagram Reels carousel

### Caption Strategy
- Short, punchy (TikTok truncates long captions)
- Use exactly 5 hashtags (2 broad + 2 niche + 1 branded) — TikTok caps at 5 since Aug 2025
- Ask a question to drive comments
- "Save this for later" — triggers save behavior

## 5. LinkedIn Carousel Best Practices

### Algorithm Signals
- **Dwell time** — LinkedIn heavily weights time spent reading
- **Comments** (especially long, thoughtful ones)
- **Shares** to feed or DMs
- **Profile visits** after viewing carousel
- **Document downloads** — unique to LinkedIn PDF carousels

### Design Rules
| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| PDF format preferred | Higher quality, smoother experience |
| Clean, professional design | LinkedIn audience expects polish |
| 4:5 or 1:1 aspect ratio | Feed optimization |
| Minimal text per page | Scannable, not essay-like |
| Brand colors consistent | Professional credibility |
| Include page numbers | Completion drive + professionalism |
| First page = hook headline ONLY | No cluttered cover pages |
| Last page = author info + CTA | Build authority |

### Content Types That Perform Best
1. **Industry insights / data analysis** — "State of [Industry] 2026"
2. **Framework/methodology reveals** — Original thinking
3. **Career advice / lessons learned** — Personal experience
4. **How-to guides** — Tactical, implementable
5. **Conference/event takeaways** — Timely content
6. **Contrarian industry takes** — Thought leadership

### LinkedIn-Specific Features
- PDF carousels get 3x more engagement than image posts
- Document posts stay in feed longer (algorithm favors dwell time)
- LinkedIn shows "X pages" count — more pages = curiosity
- Can be reshared with commentary — design for share-ability
- Show up in LinkedIn search — use keyword-rich first page

### Caption Strategy
- First line = bold hook with line break (forces "see more" click)
- Share personal context/story behind the carousel
- End with a question that invites expertise sharing
- Tag relevant people/companies for reach
- 3-5 hashtags (industry-specific, not generic) — LinkedIn hashtags DO help discoverability in search
- Add "♻️ Repost if you agree" for share signal

### Posting Cadence
- 2-3 document posts per week for growth
- Best times: 7-8 AM, 12 PM, 5-6 PM (business hours)
- Tuesday-Thursday highest engagement
- Avoid weekends (lower business audience online)

## 6. Cross-Platform Carousel Strategy

### Repurpose Matrix

| Original Platform | Repurpose To | Adjustments Needed |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Instagram 4:5 | LinkedIn 4:5 | Professional tone, remove "swipe →", add page numbers |
| Instagram 4:5 | TikTok 9:16 | Extend canvas height, bolder text, add music |
| TikTok 9:16 | Instagram Reels 9:16 | Same format, adjust caption + hashtags |
| LinkedIn PDF | Instagram 4:5 | More visual, less text, add "swipe →" |
| LinkedIn PDF | TikTok 9:16 | Bold + colorful redesign, shorter, add music |

### Universal Design Principles
1. **Text-safe zones** — Keep text in center 80% (avoid edges/corners cut off by UI)
2. **Mobile-first** — All carousels consumed on phones, design at phone size
3. **Thumb-stop first slide** — Must compete with video content
4. **Progressive disclosure** — Each slide reveals something new
5. **Visual consistency** — Same fonts, colors, layout patterns across slides
6. **Accessibility** — High contrast text, readable font sizes (min 14pt body, 24pt headlines)

## 7. Carousel Copywriting Formulas

### Hook Slide (Slide 1)

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Number + Bold Claim | "7 AI Tools That Will Replace Your Job by 2027" |
| Question Hook | "Why Are Top Creators Switching to This?" |
| Curiosity Gap | "I Tested 50 AI Tools. Only 3 Were Worth It." |
| Contrarian | "Stop Posting Reels. Here's Why." |
| Data Shock | "98% of Carousels Fail. Here's the 2% Formula." |
| "This vs That" | "Canva vs Figma: The REAL Difference" |

### Content Slides (Slides 2-N)

| Pattern | Structure |
|---------|-----------|
| Tip Format | "✅ [ACTION] — [WHY IT WORKS]" |
| Numbered List | "#3: [TIP] — [ONE LINE EXPLANATION]" |
| Compare/Contrast | "❌ [WRONG WAY] → ✅ [RIGHT WAY]" |
| Data Point | "[NUMBER] — [WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU]" |
| Quote + Insight | ""[QUOTE]" — Here's why this matters..." |

### CTA Slide (Last)

| CTA Type | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Follow CTA | "Follow for daily [TOPIC] tips" |
| Save CTA | "Save this for your next [TASK]" |
| Share CTA | "Send this to someone who needs it" |
| Comment CTA | "Which tip was most useful? Comment below" |
| Link CTA | "Full guide → link in bio" |
| Multi-CTA | "💾 Save • 🔄 Share • 👤 Follow" |

## 8. Visual Design Best Practices

### Typography Hierarchy
```
HEADLINE: 28-36pt, Bold, ALL CAPS (accent color for power word)
Subhead:  18-22pt, Semibold, Mixed case
Body:     14-16pt, Regular, Mixed case
Caption:  12-14pt, Light, Mixed case
```

### Color Usage
- **Background**: Dark (better readability, premium feel) or clean white
- **Primary text**: White on dark bg, dark gray on light bg
- **Accent**: ONE accent color for keywords/highlights (brand color)
- **Avoid**: More than 3 colors per slide, neon on white, low contrast

### Layout Patterns
| Pattern | Best For | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Centered stack** | Tips, quotes | Text stacked vertically, centered |
| **Split panel** | Before/after, compare | Left-right or top-bottom division |
| **Full bleed image** | Hook, thumbnail | Image fills frame, text overlay in gradient zone |
| **Icon + text** | Listicles, steps | Icon left, text right (or icon top, text bottom) |
| **Data card** | Stats, numbers | Large number + context label |

### Image Integration
- Creator face: 40-60% of frame on Hook/CTA slides
- B-roll: full frame, no creator face
- Gradient overlay: bottom 30-40% for text readability
- Consistent image style across all slides (same filter, same lighting)
