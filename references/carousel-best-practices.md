# Carousel Best Practices — Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn

## 1. Platform Specs Summary

| Spec | Instagram | TikTok | LinkedIn |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Carousel name** | Carousel Post | Photo Carousel / Slides | Document Post / Carousel |
| **Max slides** | 20 | 35 | 300 (PDF pages) |
| **Ideal slides** | 7-10 | 5-8 | 8-12 |
| **Aspect ratio** | 4:5 (feed) or 9:16 (Reels) | 9:16 | 4:5 or 1:1 |
| **Resolution** | 1080x1350 (4:5) or 1080x1920 (9:16) | 1080x1920 | 1080x1350 (4:5) or 1080x1080 (1:1) |
| **Min slides** | 1 | 4 | 1 |
| **File format** | JPG/PNG (images) | JPG/PNG | PDF (recommended) or images |
| **Mixed media** | Yes (photos + videos) | No (images only) | No (PDF pages only) |
| **Text on image** | Yes, but < 20% for reach | Yes, bold + large | Yes, clean + professional |
| **Auto-advance** | No (swipe only) | No (swipe only, Photo Mode) | No (swipe only) |
| **CTA placement** | Last slide | Last slide | Last slide/page |
| **Audio support** | Music overlay on carousel | Music overlay | No audio |

### TikTok: Photo Mode vs Video Mode (CRITICAL)

TikTok has **two distinct modes** when uploading multiple photos. This catches many creators off-guard:

| Mode | Behavior | How to Access |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Video Mode (Slideshow)** — DEFAULT | Auto-play with transitions synced to music, converts photos to video | Default after selecting photos + tap Next |
| **Photo Mode (Carousel)** | Manual swipe, viewer controls pace | Must **switch at bottom of editor screen** after tap Next |

**If your carousel uploads as a "video" — you're in Video Mode. Switch to Photo Mode explicitly.**

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Recommended dimensions | 1080 x 1920 px (9:16) |
| Text-heavy carousels | 1080 x 1350 px (4:5) — leaves gap below for caption display |
| Music | Single track for entire carousel (cannot assign per-slide) |
| Max single image | 20 MB |
| Total carousel file | 500 MB |

**Safe zones for text overlay (TikTok):**
- **Top edge:** Keep text at least 150px from top (username/Following button overlap)
- **Bottom edge:** Avoid bottom 300-400px (caption, music info, engagement buttons)

## 2. Universal Carousel Structure (All Platforms)

### The HOOK → VALUE → CTA Framework

```
Slide 1: HOOK — Stop the scroll (curiosity gap, bold claim, shocking stat)
Slide 2: CONTEXT — Set up the problem or promise
Slide 3-N: VALUE — Deliver the content (tips, steps, data, insights)
Slide N+1: CTA — Tell them what to do next
```

### Slide Sequence Psychology

| Slide | Purpose | Engagement Trigger |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 (Hook) | Stop scrolling | Curiosity gap, pattern interrupt |
| 2 (Setup) | Create investment | Problem identification, "this is for you" |
| 3-7 (Value) | Deliver dopamine hits | One idea per slide, progressive reveal |
| 8-9 (Peak) | Strongest content | Most shareable insight, "save this" moment |
| Last (CTA) | Convert attention | Follow, save, share, comment, link |

### The "One Idea Per Slide" Rule
- Each slide = ONE concept, ONE visual, ONE takeaway
- If you need a paragraph, it's too much — split into 2 slides
- White space is your friend — don't crowd the frame
- Bold the KEY WORD in each slide (accent color highlight)

## 2.5. Engagement Data & Benchmarks (2025-2026)

### Carousel vs Other Formats

| Platform | Carousel Engagement | vs Other Formats | Key Multiplier |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Instagram** | 0.55-1.92% | 3.1x vs single image, +12% vs Reels | 95% higher save rate |
| **TikTok** | 6.46% | +82% likes vs video, 2.9x comments vs video | +81% total engagements vs video |
| **LinkedIn** | 6.60% | +596% vs text, +278% vs video | 2-3x more dwell time |

### Instagram Mixed-Media Carousel Advantage

| Carousel Type | Engagement Rate |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Mixed (images + video slides)** | **2.33%** |
| Video-only carousel | 1.86% |
| Image-only carousel | 1.80% |

**Insight:** Starting with static hook, transitioning to video demos mid-carousel, then static CTA = optimal structure.

### Slide-by-Slide Exit Rate Curve

| Slide | Exit Rate | Cumulative Retention |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | 23.8% | 76.2% |
| 3 | 18.5% | ~62% |
| 4 | 15.7% | ~55% |
| 9 | 13.3% | ~35-40% |
| 15 | ~12.5% | ~25-30% |

**Pattern:** Exit rates drop sharply after slide 1, then stabilize at 12-15% per slide from slide 4 onward. Users who survive first 3 slides are committed swipers. Engagement dips at slides 3-7 but recovers at slide 8+ — place a "mini-hook" or surprise in middle slides.

### Platform Prioritization

| Creator Goal | Prioritize |
|---|---|
| Maximum reach / new audiences | TikTok (carousel boost + dedicated photo feed) |
| Community building / saves | Instagram (carousel-native, saves dominant) |
| Professional authority / B2B | LinkedIn (6.60% engagement, thought leadership) |
| Rapid growth (small creator) | TikTok first, then IG carousels |

## 3. Instagram Carousel Best Practices

### Algorithm Signals
- **Watch time/dwell time** is the **#1 ranking factor** (confirmed by Adam Mosseri, Jan 2025)
- **DM shares/sends** weighted 3-5x heavier than likes — #2 ranking factor
- **Saves** weighted 3x heavier than likes — carousels have 95% higher save rate
- **Completion rate** — Instagram tracks how many slides people swipe through
- **Re-visits** — carousels that people come back to get boosted

### Second-Chance Algorithm (IG Carousel Exclusive)
If a user scrolls past a carousel without engaging, **Instagram re-serves the same post later — starting from slide 2**. No other format gets this treatment.

**Implications:**
- Carousels get **double impressions for free** — two chances to capture attention
- **Slide 2 design is strategically critical** — it may be the first slide many users see
- A 10-slide carousel keeps users engaged 30-60 seconds vs 5 seconds for a Reel
- Session duration increases **27% longer** with carousel content
- Follower growth is **41% stronger** with consistent carousel strategy

### Design Rules
| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| First slide = no text-heavy design | Feed preview must be visually striking |
| **Optimal 8-10 slides** for peak engagement | Peak reach observed around slide 13 |
| Use 4:5 aspect ratio for feed carousels | Takes up more screen real estate than 1:1 |
| Consistent color palette across all slides | Brand recognition + professional look |
| "GESER UNTUK LANJUT >" rendered in-image on all slides except CTA | Increases swipe-through rate by 20-30% |
| Number your slides ("3/8") | Creates completion drive |
| Last slide = face + CTA | Personal connection converts |

### Content Types That Perform Best
1. **Educational listicles** — "7 Tools That Changed My Life"
2. **Before/After** — Transformation stories
3. **Step-by-step tutorials** — Process breakdowns
4. **Myth vs Reality** — Contrarian takes
5. **Data storytelling** — Stats with visual context
6. **Mini case studies** — Real results, real numbers

### Caption Strategy
- First line = hook (matches slide 1 hook)
- Body = expand on carousel content (not repeat it)
- End with question or micro-CTA
- 5 hashtags max (in caption, not comments) — Instagram algorithm penalizes >5 since Dec 2025
- Tag relevant accounts for reach

### Posting Cadence
- 3-5 carousels per week for growth phase
- Best times: 7-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 7-9 PM (local timezone)
- Tuesday-Thursday highest engagement
- Avoid posting within 2 hours of a previous post

## 4. TikTok Carousel Best Practices

### Algorithm Signals (Specific Benchmarks)

| Signal | Target Benchmark | Weight |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Swipe-through rate (slide 1→2) | **60%+** | Primary |
| Dwell time per slide | 3-5 seconds | Primary |
| **Reverse swipes** (swipe backward) | Any occurrence | **Primary (strongest signal)** |
| Completion rate | 80%+ see all slides | Primary |
| Saves | High = "high-value content" | Secondary |
| Comments | Especially first hour after posting | Secondary |
| New follows from post | — | Secondary |

- TikTok now shows videos to **followers FIRST** (2026 change). If followers engage, it goes wider.
- Completion rate for viral: **70%+** (up from 50% in 2024)
- "Qualified Views" (2026 metric): views longer than 5 seconds count as quality views
- **Long captions on carousels get 3x more views** (TikTok official guidance)
- **On-slide text is NOW INDEXED** by TikTok search — use keywords on slides for SEO
- TikTok has a **dedicated photo-only Explore feed** (launched early 2025) — carousel boost is active

### Design Rules
| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Switch to Photo Mode** (not Video Mode) | Default is slideshow/auto-play. Photo Mode = swipeable carousel |
| 9:16 preferred, 4:5 for text-heavy | 4:5 leaves gap below for caption, avoids overlap |
| Bold text, large font (min 60px) | Readability on mobile |
| High contrast colors | Stands out in fast-scrolling feed |
| First slide = thumbnail in For You Page | Must compete with video thumbnails |
| Keep slides to 5-10 (sweet spot: 7) | Hook + 5 value slides + CTA |
| Use trending sounds/music | Algorithm boost from audio signals |
| Respect safe zones | 150px from top, 300-400px from bottom |

### Content Types That Perform Best
1. **"POV" stories** — Relatable scenarios with photo narrative
2. **Ranking/Tier lists** — Opinionated takes spark comments
3. **Photo dumps with narrative** — Aesthetic + storytelling
4. **Quick tips** — Bite-sized education
5. **"Things I wish I knew"** — Wisdom format
6. **Controversial takes** — Engagement bait (use carefully)

### TikTok-Specific Features
- Add music/sound to carousel — increases reach significantly
- Use text-to-speech on key slides
- Enable comments — engagement signals
- Pin top comment as extended CTA
- Cross-post to Instagram Reels carousel

### Caption Strategy
- Short, punchy (TikTok truncates long captions)
- Use exactly 5 hashtags (2 broad + 2 niche + 1 branded) — TikTok caps at 5 since Aug 2025
- Ask a question to drive comments
- "Save this for later" — triggers save behavior

## 5. LinkedIn Carousel Best Practices

### Algorithm Signals
- **Dwell time** — LinkedIn heavily weights time spent reading (2-3x more for carousels)
- **Depth Score** (2026) — replaced vanity engagement as primary distribution signal. Measures how much of your carousel viewers actually see, not just initial impressions.
- **Comments** (especially long, thoughtful ones) — #1 distribution signal on LinkedIn
- **Shares** to feed or DMs
- **Profile visits** after viewing carousel
- **Document downloads** — unique to LinkedIn PDF carousels

### Design Rules
| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| PDF format preferred | Higher quality, smoother experience |
| Clean, professional design | LinkedIn audience expects polish |
| 4:5 or 1:1 aspect ratio | Feed optimization |
| Minimal text per page | Scannable, not essay-like |
| Brand colors consistent | Professional credibility |
| Include page numbers | Completion drive + professionalism |
| First page = hook headline ONLY | No cluttered cover pages |
| Last page = author info + CTA | Build authority |

### Content Types That Perform Best
1. **Industry insights / data analysis** — "State of [Industry] 2026"
2. **Framework/methodology reveals** — Original thinking
3. **Career advice / lessons learned** — Personal experience
4. **How-to guides** — Tactical, implementable
5. **Conference/event takeaways** — Timely content
6. **Contrarian industry takes** — Thought leadership

### LinkedIn-Specific Features
- PDF carousels get 3x more engagement than image posts
- Document posts stay in feed longer (algorithm favors dwell time)
- LinkedIn shows "X pages" count — more pages = curiosity
- Can be reshared with commentary — design for share-ability
- Show up in LinkedIn search — use keyword-rich first page

### Caption Strategy
- First line = bold hook with line break (forces "see more" click)
- Share personal context/story behind the carousel
- End with a question that invites expertise sharing
- Tag relevant people/companies for reach
- 3-5 hashtags (industry-specific, not generic) — LinkedIn hashtags DO help discoverability in search
- Add "♻️ Repost if you agree" for share signal

### Posting Cadence
- 2-3 document posts per week for growth
- Best times: 7-8 AM, 12 PM, 5-6 PM (business hours)
- Tuesday-Thursday highest engagement
- Avoid weekends (lower business audience online)

## 6. Cross-Platform Carousel Strategy

### Repurpose Matrix

| Original Platform | Repurpose To | Adjustments Needed |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Instagram 4:5 | LinkedIn 4:5 | Professional tone, remove "swipe →", add page numbers |
| Instagram 4:5 | TikTok 9:16 | Extend canvas height, bolder text, add music |
| TikTok 9:16 | Instagram Reels 9:16 | Same format, adjust caption + hashtags |
| LinkedIn PDF | Instagram 4:5 | More visual, less text, add "swipe →" |
| LinkedIn PDF | TikTok 9:16 | Bold + colorful redesign, shorter, add music |

**Warning:** Platforms detect and may bury directly cross-posted content, especially if aspect ratios don't match native specs or watermarks from other platforms are visible. Always re-export at correct dimensions and adapt captions per platform.

### Universal Design Principles
1. **Text-safe zones** — Keep text in center 80% (avoid edges/corners cut off by UI)
2. **Mobile-first** — All carousels consumed on phones, design at phone size
3. **Thumb-stop first slide** — Must compete with video content
4. **Progressive disclosure** — Each slide reveals something new
5. **Visual consistency** — Same fonts, colors, layout patterns across slides
6. **Accessibility** — High contrast text, readable font sizes (min 14pt body, 24pt headlines)

## 7. Carousel Copywriting Formulas

### Hook Slide (Slide 1)

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Number + Bold Claim | "7 AI Tools That Will Replace Your Job by 2027" |
| Question Hook | "Why Are Top Creators Switching to This?" |
| Curiosity Gap | "I Tested 50 AI Tools. Only 3 Were Worth It." |
| Contrarian | "Stop Posting Reels. Here's Why." |
| Data Shock | "98% of Carousels Fail. Here's the 2% Formula." |
| "This vs That" | "Canva vs Figma: The REAL Difference" |

### Content Slides (Slides 2-N)

| Pattern | Structure |
|---------|-----------|
| Tip Format | "✅ [ACTION] — [WHY IT WORKS]" |
| Numbered List | "#3: [TIP] — [ONE LINE EXPLANATION]" |
| Compare/Contrast | "❌ [WRONG WAY] → ✅ [RIGHT WAY]" |
| Data Point | "[NUMBER] — [WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU]" |
| Quote + Insight | ""[QUOTE]" — Here's why this matters..." |

### CTA Slide (Last)

| CTA Type | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Follow CTA | "Follow for daily [TOPIC] tips" |
| Save CTA | "Save this for your next [TASK]" |
| Share CTA | "Send this to someone who needs it" |
| Comment CTA | "Which tip was most useful? Comment below" |
| Link CTA | "Full guide → link in bio" |
| Multi-CTA | "💾 Save • 🔄 Share • 👤 Follow" |

## 8. Visual Design Best Practices

### Typography Hierarchy
```
HEADLINE: 48-72pt, EXTRA BOLD / BLACK weight, ALL CAPS (accent color for power word)
          — MUST dominate the gradient zone. Think billboard, not book.
Subhead:  24-32pt, Bold, Mixed case
Body:     16-20pt, Semibold, Mixed case
Caption:  14-16pt, Regular, Mixed case
```
**Key Rule:** Headlines must be MASSIVE and impactful. The text should feel like it's punching the viewer in the face. If the headline doesn't dominate the bottom half of the image, it's too small.

### Color Usage
- **Background**: Dark (better readability, premium feel) or clean white
- **Primary text**: White on dark bg, dark gray on light bg
- **Accent**: ONE accent color for keywords/highlights (brand color)
- **Avoid**: More than 3 colors per slide, neon on white, low contrast

### Layout Patterns
| Pattern | Best For | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Centered stack** | Tips, quotes | Text stacked vertically, centered |
| **Split panel** | Before/after, compare | Left-right or top-bottom division |
| **Full bleed image** | Hook, thumbnail | Image fills frame, text overlay in gradient zone |
| **Icon + text** | Listicles, steps | Icon left, text right (or icon top, text bottom) |
| **Data card** | Stats, numbers | Large number + context label |

### Image Integration (Text Rendered IN-IMAGE)
- Creator face: 40-60% of frame on Hook/CTA slides
- B-roll: full frame, no creator face (unless user approves for scenes with human figures)
- Gradient overlay: bottom half with text rendered directly in AI-generated image
- All text (headlines, accents, branding, SWIPE CTA) is part of the Nano Banana Pro prompt — NOT post-production
- Consistent image style across all slides (same filter, same lighting, same text styling)
- Brand icon (CENTER of image, above watermark, thirty percent opacity) + @handle watermark (CENTER of image, below brand icon, thirty percent opacity) rendered in every slide
