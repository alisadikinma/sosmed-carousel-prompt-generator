# Caption Copywriting — Multi-Platform Reference

> Configurable values (handle, portfolio URL, hashtag limits, caption language) are in `global-config.md`. This file contains caption formulas, tone guidance, and platform-specific writing tips.

## Default Language

Caption language: per `global-config.md` (`caption_language`). Other language only when user explicitly requests.

**Important:** Captions for all 4 platforms (IG + TikTok + LinkedIn + Threads) are generated by DEFAULT with every carousel output. User can say "IG aja" or "skip LinkedIn" to filter.

---

## 1. Platform Character Limits

| Platform | Max Characters | Truncation Point | What Shows Before "...more" |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Instagram | 2,200 | 125 chars | First ~125 chars in feed |
| TikTok | 4,000 | ~100-150 chars | First ~100-150 chars in FYP |
| LinkedIn | 3,000 | 210 (desktop) / 110 (mobile) | First line before "...see more" |
| Threads | 500 | ~100 chars | First ~100 chars in feed |

**Rule:** Your hook MUST land before the truncation point. Everything after is bonus.

---

## 2. Hashtag Strategy (5-Hashtag Era)

Since late 2025, both Instagram and TikTok penalize hashtag spam. Less is more.

| Platform | Max Hashtags | Formula | Placement |
|----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Instagram | 5 (Dec 2025 update) | 2 broad + 2 niche + 1 branded | In caption body (not comments) |
| TikTok | 5 (Aug 2025 update) | 2 broad + 2 niche + 1 branded | End of caption |
| LinkedIn | 3-5 | Industry-specific, not generic | End of post |

### Hashtag Formula: 2-2-1

```
2 BROAD:   High-volume, category-level (#AI, #TechTips)
2 NICHE:   Specific to topic (#AIImageGeneration, #CarouselDesign)
1 BRANDED: Your handle or series name (#YourBrand, #YourSeries)
```

### What NOT to Do
- No banned/flagged hashtags (check before posting)
- No generic filler (#love, #instagood, #fyp)
- No more than 5 — platforms actively suppress >5 hashtag posts
- No hashtag-first captions — hook first, hashtags at end
- No same hashtag set on every post — rotate to avoid spam filters

### The Hashtag Role Shift (2025-2026)

Hashtags are now **topic labels for categorization**, NOT reach drivers. All 3 platforms moved to AI-powered semantic discovery.

| Platform | Real Reach Driver | Hashtag Role |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| Instagram | Caption keywords (+30% more reach than hashtag-heavy posts) | Topic labeling for search index |
| TikTok | Caption keywords (+20-40% visibility boost) | Content categorization + search |
| LinkedIn | Semantic AI reads full post text directly | SEO keyword for search only |

**Key shifts:**
- Instagram removed hashtag following (Dec 2024) and reduced algorithmic weight
- LinkedIn removed hashtag following, "Talks About" section, and hashtag suggestions (late 2024)
- TikTok indexes on-screen text via OCR — hashtags are secondary to caption keywords
- Instagram captions now appear in Google search results (July 2025)

### Avoiding Shadowban Triggers
- Check each hashtag before posting — if search shows zero results, it may be restricted
- Never use identical hashtag set on consecutive posts
- Avoid bot-like behavior (mass follow/unfollow, copy-paste comments)
- No cross-platform watermarks (IG deprioritizes TikTok watermarks and vice versa)
- No irrelevant hashtags — causes algorithmic confusion + potential suppression
- If shadowbanned: stop posting 48-72h, delete flagged content, clear cache, remove banned tags

## 3. Caption Formula Per Platform

### Instagram Caption Formula

```
[Pattern interrupt — question, bold claim, or shocking stat (≤125 chars before truncation)]

[Context, backstory, or deeper insight not in the slides]
[Personal experience or data point]

[Specific ask: save, share, follow, comment, link in bio]

#Broad1 #Broad2 #Niche1 #Niche2 #Branded
```

**Instagram Tone:** Visual storytelling, personal, community-driven. Use line breaks for readability. Emojis OK but not excessive.

**Output format:** One continuous caption — NO section labels (Hook/Body/CTA/Hashtags). Hashtags at the end, no label.

**Character Budget:**
| Section | Max Chars | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Hook | 125 | Must work as standalone |
| Body | 1,800 | Expand on carousel, don't repeat |
| CTA | 100 | One clear action |
| Hashtags | 175 | 5 hashtags max |
| **Total** | **≤2,200** | |

### TikTok Caption Formula

```
[Casual, trend-aware, Gen Z hook (≤100 chars before truncation) — "POV:", "Wait for it...", provocative question]

[TikTok search indexes captions — include searchable keywords]
[Short paragraphs, punchy sentences]

[Ask question → drive comments. "Save for later" → drive saves]

#Broad1 #Broad2 #Niche1 #Niche2 #Branded
```

**TikTok Tone:** Casual, trend-native, conversational. Use text-speak sparingly. Write like you talk. No corporate polish.

**Output format:** One continuous caption — NO section labels. Hashtags at the end, no label.

**Character Budget:**
| Section | Max Chars | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Hook | 100 | Must survive truncation |
| Body | 3,600 | SEO keywords for search |
| CTA | 150 | Question + save/share ask |
| Hashtags | 150 | 5 hashtags max |
| **Total** | **≤4,000** | |

### LinkedIn Caption Formula

```
[Professional insight, contrarian take, or industry data (≤110 chars before truncation)]
[LINE BREAK — forces "...see more" click]

[Personal story or framework]
[Data-backed insight]
[Actionable takeaway]

[Open question inviting expertise sharing]
[Optional: "Repost if you agree" for share signal]

[Link to full article, tool, or resource]

Per global-config.md LinkedIn Cross-Promotion Block

#IndustryTag1 #IndustryTag2 #TopicTag
```

**LinkedIn Cross-Promotion (MANDATORY):** Every LinkedIn caption must end with the cross-promotion block from `global-config.md` (LinkedIn Cross-Promotion Block section) before hashtags.

**LinkedIn Tone:** Professional but human. Thought leadership. Share frameworks, not tips. Use "I" statements for authority. No emojis in first line.

**Output format:** One continuous caption — NO section labels. Link inline if applicable. Hashtags at the end, no label.

**Character Budget:**
| Section | Max Chars | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Hook | 110 | Must work on mobile (110 char truncation) |
| Body | 2,500 | Thought leadership, frameworks |
| CTA | 200 | Open question + repost ask |
| Link | 100 | One link only |
| Hashtags | 90 | 3-5 industry hashtags |
| **Total** | **≤3,000** | |

### Threads Caption Formula

```
[Conversational hook — opinion or hot take (≤100 chars before truncation)]

[Short opinion-driven body — personal, community-first]
[Threads rewards conversation starters, keep it punchy]

[Question or opinion prompt to drive replies]
```

**Threads Tone:** Conversational, opinion-driven, community-first. No hashtags (Threads does not use hashtags for discovery). Write like a group chat message to your smartest friends.

**Output format:** One continuous caption — NO section labels. NO hashtags on Threads.

**Character Budget:**
| Section | Max Chars | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Hook | 100 | Must work as standalone in feed |
| Body | 300 | Short, punchy, opinion-driven |
| CTA | 100 | Question or opinion prompt |
| **Total** | **≤500** | |

## 4. Emotional Triggers Per Platform

| Trigger | Instagram | TikTok | LinkedIn |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Curiosity gap** | "I tested 50 tools. Only 3 worked." | "No one tells you about..." | "After 5 years, here's what I learned:" |
| **Vulnerability** | Personal story + lesson learned | Self-deprecating humor, oddly specific relatability | Professional failure story + framework |
| **FOMO** | "Only available this week" | "Only 1% of people know..." | "The companies doing this are pulling ahead" |
| **Hot take / Contrarian** | "Stop posting Reels. Here's why." | "Unpopular opinion: [bold claim]" | "Unpopular opinion: [industry take]" |
| **Social proof** | Testimonials, before/after | "If you know, you know" | Data-backed insights, case studies |
| **Aspiration** | Transformation stories | "I did X in just Y days" | Career journey, milestone sharing |

### TikTok-Specific Language Patterns (Gen Z / Millennial)
- **Lowercase aesthetic** — intentional lack of capitalization signals casualness
- **Oddly specific relatability** — the more niche, the better it resonates ("When your brother tried to cut the line at Thanksgiving but you've lived off cottage cheese and salads for an entire year")
- **Hyperbolic minimalism** — "This is everything" / "I'm deceased"
- **Self-call-out** — "Not me [doing something relatable]..."
- **Trailing emphasis** — "The way [thing happened]..."
- **Ironic detachment** — self-aware humor about own habits
- **Yellow font = vulnerable** — Gen Z color-coded system for deeply personal content

### LinkedIn Engagement Bait — AVOID THESE
LinkedIn's 2026 algorithm uses NLP to detect and **actively suppress engagement bait** (-60% reach penalty):
- "Comment YES if you agree" — penalized
- "Type 1 if you agree, 2 if you disagree" — penalized
- "Like for A, Heart for B" (reaction polling) — penalized
- Engagement pods (reciprocal patterns) — AI detects, applies shadowban

**What works instead:** Naturally thought-provoking content that invites genuine professional responses. "What's your experience with X?" (acceptable) vs "Type 1 if you agree" (penalized).

## 5. Hook Templates Per Platform

**The 3-Second Rule:** 84.3% of viral TikTok videos use psychological hook triggers within the first 3 seconds. Videos with 70-85% retention at 3 seconds receive 2.2x more total views.

### Instagram Hooks (≤125 chars)

| Type | Template | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Curiosity gap | "I tested [N] [things]. Only [N] were worth it." | "I tested 50 AI tools. Only 3 were worth it." |
| Bold claim | "[N]% of [people] don't know this about [topic]." | "98% of creators don't know this about AI." |
| Question | "Why are top [people] switching to [thing]?" | "Why are top creators switching to AI carousels?" |
| Data shock | "[Shocking number] — and most people ignore it." | "120 terabytes per second — and most people ignore it." |
| Contrarian | "Stop [common advice]. Here's why." | "Stop posting Reels. Here's why." |

### TikTok Hooks (≤100 chars)

| Type | Template | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| POV | "POV: you just discovered [thing]" | "POV: you just discovered AI carousel generators" |
| Wait for it | "This changes everything about [topic]..." | "This changes everything about content creation..." |
| Ranking | "[N] [things] ranked worst to best" | "5 AI tools ranked worst to best" |
| Challenge | "Try this and thank me later" | "Try this and thank me later" |
| Relatable | "When you realize [relatable thing]..." | "When you realize AI can do your carousels..." |
| Self-call-out | "Not me [doing something relatable]..." | "Not me spending 3 hours on a carousel..." |
| Hyper-specific | "When [oddly specific scenario]..." | "When you open Canva for a 'quick edit' at 2am..." |
| Identity | "Tell me you're [identity] without telling me" | "Tell me you're a content creator without telling me" |
| Pipeline | "The [thing] to [other thing] pipeline is real" | "The 'just one more edit' to 3am pipeline is real" |

### LinkedIn Hooks (≤110 chars)

| Type | Template | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Insight | "After [N] years in [field], here's what I learned:" | "After 5 years in AI, here's what I learned:" |
| Framework | "The [Name] Framework for [outcome]:" | "The 70/30 Framework for holiday content:" |
| Data | "[Company] just [did thing]. Here's what it means." | "Google just launched Gemini 3. Here's what it means." |
| Contrarian | "Unpopular opinion: [take]" | "Unpopular opinion: Carousels outperform Reels." |
| Story | "I [did thing]. The results surprised me." | "I replaced all my designs with AI. The results surprised me." |
| Wish list | "[N] things I wish I knew about [topic]" | "5 things I wish I knew about AI content creation" |

## 6. CTA Best Practices

### CTA Psychology

**Engagement Ladder** (lowest → highest commitment):
```
Like → Save → Comment → Share/DM Send → Follow
```

**Key principles:**
- **One primary CTA per post** — single CTA = +371% clicks vs multiple CTAs. Multiple CTAs create decision fatigue.
- **Micro-commitments** — small asks (poll tap, like) make users more likely to take bigger actions (comment, follow) due to consistency bias.
- **Soft vs Hard CTA** — soft ("What's your experience?") for cold audiences; hard ("Comment GUIDE for the PDF") for warm audiences.
- Posts with clear CTAs = **+25% CTR**. Posts without CTA = massive missed opportunity.
- Carousel dual-CTA: **soft CTA mid-carousel + hard CTA on last slide**.

### Algorithm Weight Signals Per Platform

| Signal | Instagram | TikTok | LinkedIn |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| DM shares/sends | **3-5x** heavier than likes | High weight | N/A |
| Saves | **3x** heavier than likes | Strongest signal | "Depth Score" |
| Comments | High value | High value (especially first hour) | **#1 distribution signal** |
| Likes | Lowest weight | Moderate | Low (bait = -60% penalty) |
| Watch/dwell time | **#1 ranking factor** (Mosseri Jan 2025) | Primary (70%+ completion for viral) | 2-3x more for carousels |

### CTA by Goal

| Goal | Best CTA Format | Data |
|------|----------------|------|
| **Comments** | "Comment [KEYWORD] for free [resource]" | +70% comments (IG), triggers DM automation |
| **Comments** | Fill-in-the-blank: "My favorite ___ is ___" | Lowest barrier to entry |
| **Comments** | "Agree or disagree: [bold claim]?" | Debate-driven, high volume |
| **Comments** | "Which one would you pick?" | Simple choice = low friction |
| **Saves** | "Save this for the next time you ___" | +30% reach lift, 3x algorithm weight |
| **Shares** | "Send this to the person who handles ___" | 3-5x algorithm weight on IG |
| **Follows** | "Follow for [specific value] every [frequency]" | Series content = +40-60% engagement |
| **Follows (TikTok)** | Mid-roll CTA at 50% retention point | 3x more effective than end-of-video |
| **Likes** | "Double tap if this resonates" | +11% engagement (IG only). Don't waste primary CTA on this |

### Comment-to-DM Keyword CTA Funnel
"Comment [KEYWORD] and I'll DM you the [resource]" — user comments keyword, automated DM (via ManyChat) delivers resource + captures email.
- IG: ManyChat integration mature, auto-DM works
- TikTok: viewer must message you first (auto-DM not fully supported yet)
- Can double lead volume (1,000+ leads/month reported)

### Platform-Specific CTA Rules

| Platform | Do | Don't |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Instagram | Save + Share CTAs (highest algorithm weight) | Generic "like this post" |
| TikTok | Question CTAs + "Save for later" | "PLEASE follow and share!" (desperate tone) |
| LinkedIn | Open questions inviting expertise | "Comment YES if you agree" (-60% reach penalty) |

### CTA Phrases That Convert

| Action | English | Bahasa Indonesia |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Follow | "Follow for daily [topic] tips" | "Follow buat konten [topic] tiap hari" |
| Save | "Save this for when you need it" | "Save post ini, penting!" |
| Share | "Send this to someone who needs it" | "Share ke temen yang perlu tau" |
| Comment | "Which tip was most useful?" | "Comment pendapat kamu" |
| Comment keyword | "Comment GUIDE for the free checklist" | "Comment TEMPLATE buat dapetin gratis" |
| Link | "Full guide → link in bio" | "Link di bio ya" |

### Emoji Usage in CTAs

| Platform | Recommended | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Instagram | 3-5 relevant emojis per caption | +48% engagement. Use functional emojis (pointing, checkmarks) |
| TikTok | 1-3 max | Minimal emoji culture. Text-based wit preferred |
| LinkedIn | Sparingly, never in first line | Professional context. Functional only |

---

## 7. TikTok Triple-Layer Keyword SEO

TikTok indexes 3 text layers simultaneously for content classification and search:

| Layer | What It Is | SEO Weight |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Caption text** | Description below video | Highest — first 3 words = primary SEO weight |
| **On-screen text** | Text overlay on video/image | OCR-scanned within first 2-3 seconds |
| **Spoken audio** | Voice in video | Transcribed and indexed automatically |

**Strategy:** Use **different but related keywords** across all 3 layers to maximize keyword coverage.

```
Example:
- Spoken: "morning routine"
- On-screen text: "5am productivity hack"
- Caption: "How I changed my morning for better focus"
```

- Place primary keyword within first 3 words of caption
- Use 2-3 keywords naturally (avoid keyword stuffing)
- 40% of Gen Z uses TikTok over Google for search — caption SEO matters

---

## 8. Bahasa Indonesia Caption Conventions

When writing captions in Bahasa Indonesia (on user request or for Indonesian-audience carousels).

### Language Rules
- Use "kamu" not "Anda" (unless targeting corporate LinkedIn)
- Mix Bahasa + English naturally: "Ini literally mind-blowing banget"
- Slang OK for IG/TikTok: "gue/gw", "lo", "nggak", "banget", "slay"
- LinkedIn: professional Bahasa, minimal slang
- Short punchy sentences for all platforms

### Bahasa Caption Template

```
[Bahasa hook — provocative question or bold claim in mixed Bahasa-English]

[Bahasa body — keep it casual for IG/TikTok, professional for LinkedIn, conversational for Threads]
[Use Indonesian references and context]

[Bahasa CTA — see CTA phrases table above]

[Mix English and Bahasa hashtags (omit for Threads)]
```

### Bahasa Hook Examples

| English | Bahasa Adaptation |
|---------|------------------|
| "What Actually Happens in 1 Second" | "YANG TERJADI DALAM 1 DETIK DI BUMI" |
| "7 AI Tools You Need Right Now" | "7 TOOLS AI YANG KAMU HARUS COBA SEKARANG" |
| "This will change everything" | "INI BAKAL UBAH SEGALANYA" |
| "Stop doing this mistake" | "STOP LAKUIN KESALAHAN INI" |
| "You won't believe this" | "KAMU NGGAK BAKAL PERCAYA INI" |

---

## 9. Cross-Platform Caption Adaptation

When adapting the same carousel across platforms:

| From → To | Key Adjustments |
|-----------|----------------|
| IG → TikTok | More casual, shorter, add trend references, same hashtag count |
| IG → LinkedIn | More professional, add data/framework, different hashtags, add link |
| TikTok → IG | Slightly more polished, keep energy, adjust hashtags |
| TikTok → LinkedIn | Complete tone shift, add insight/framework, professional language |
| LinkedIn → IG | Simplify, add personality, visual language, emojis OK |
| LinkedIn → TikTok | Casual rewrite, Gen Z tone, trending references |

### Adaptation Checklist
- [ ] Hook fits within platform truncation point
- [ ] Tone matches platform culture
- [ ] Hashtag count matches platform rules (IG 5/TikTok 5/LinkedIn 3-5/Threads 0)
- [ ] CTA uses platform-native actions (save/share vs repost)
- [ ] Threads version stays under 500 chars, no hashtags
- [ ] Character count within platform limit
- [ ] Caption language matches user preference (English default)
- [ ] In-image text: per global-config.md Language section (bilingual default). Single language on user request
- [ ] No cross-platform watermarks (IG deprioritizes TikTok watermarks and vice versa)
- [ ] Emoji density matches platform culture (3-5 IG, 1-3 TikTok, minimal LinkedIn)
