# Caption Copywriting — Multi-Platform Reference

## 1. Platform Character Limits

| Platform | Max Characters | Truncation Point | What Shows Before "...more" |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Instagram | 2,200 | 125 chars | First ~125 chars in feed |
| TikTok | 4,000 | ~100-150 chars | First ~100-150 chars in FYP |
| LinkedIn | 3,000 | 210 (desktop) / 110 (mobile) | First line before "...see more" |

**Rule:** Your hook MUST land before the truncation point. Everything after is bonus.

## 2. Hashtag Strategy (5-Hashtag Era)

Since late 2025, both Instagram and TikTok penalize hashtag spam. Less is more.

| Platform | Max Hashtags | Formula | Placement |
|----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Instagram | 5 (Dec 2025 update) | 2 broad + 2 niche + 1 branded | In caption body (not comments) |
| TikTok | 5 (Aug 2025 update) | 2 broad + 2 niche + 1 branded | End of caption |
| LinkedIn | 3-5 | Industry-specific, not generic | End of post |

### Hashtag Formula: 2-2-1

```
2 BROAD:   High-volume, category-level (#AI, #TechTips)
2 NICHE:   Specific to topic (#AIImageGeneration, #CarouselDesign)
1 BRANDED: Your handle or series name (#YourBrand, #YourSeries)
```

### What NOT to Do
- No banned/flagged hashtags (check before posting)
- No generic filler (#love, #instagood, #fyp)
- No more than 5 — platforms actively suppress >5 hashtag posts
- No hashtag-first captions — hook first, hashtags at end

## 3. Caption Formula Per Platform

### Instagram Caption Formula

```
HOOK (≤125 chars):
[Pattern interrupt — question, bold claim, or shocking stat]

BODY (expand, don't repeat carousel):
[Context, backstory, or deeper insight not in the slides]
[Personal experience or data point]

CTA (action-oriented):
[Specific ask: save, share, follow, comment, link in bio]

HASHTAGS (5):
#Broad1 #Broad2 #Niche1 #Niche2 #Branded
```

**Instagram Tone:** Visual storytelling, personal, community-driven. Use line breaks for readability. Emojis OK but not excessive.

**Character Budget:**
| Section | Max Chars | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Hook | 125 | Must work as standalone |
| Body | 1,800 | Expand on carousel, don't repeat |
| CTA | 100 | One clear action |
| Hashtags | 175 | 5 hashtags max |
| **Total** | **≤2,200** | |

### TikTok Caption Formula

```
HOOK (≤100 chars):
[Casual, trend-aware, Gen Z tone — "POV:", "Wait for it...", provocative question]

BODY (SEO-optimized):
[TikTok search indexes captions — include searchable keywords]
[Short paragraphs, punchy sentences]

CTA (engagement-driven):
[Ask question → drive comments. "Save for later" → drive saves]

HASHTAGS (5):
#Broad1 #Broad2 #Niche1 #Niche2 #Branded
```

**TikTok Tone:** Casual, trend-native, conversational. Use text-speak sparingly. Write like you talk. No corporate polish.

**Character Budget:**
| Section | Max Chars | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Hook | 100 | Must survive truncation |
| Body | 3,600 | SEO keywords for search |
| CTA | 150 | Question + save/share ask |
| Hashtags | 150 | 5 hashtags max |
| **Total** | **≤4,000** | |

### LinkedIn Caption Formula

```
HOOK (≤110 chars):
[Professional insight, contrarian take, or industry data]
[LINE BREAK — forces "...see more" click]

BODY (thought leadership):
[Personal story or framework]
[Data-backed insight]
[Actionable takeaway]

CTA (conversation-starter):
[Open question inviting expertise sharing]
[Optional: "Repost if you agree" for share signal]

LINK (if applicable):
[Link to full article, tool, or resource]

HASHTAGS (3-5):
#IndustryTag1 #IndustryTag2 #TopicTag
```

**LinkedIn Tone:** Professional but human. Thought leadership. Share frameworks, not tips. Use "I" statements for authority. No emojis in first line.

**Character Budget:**
| Section | Max Chars | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Hook | 110 | Must work on mobile (110 char truncation) |
| Body | 2,500 | Thought leadership, frameworks |
| CTA | 200 | Open question + repost ask |
| Link | 100 | One link only |
| Hashtags | 90 | 3-5 industry hashtags |
| **Total** | **≤3,000** | |

## 6. Bahasa Indonesia Caption Conventions

When creating captions for Indonesian audience (triggered by `references/localization-id.md`):

### Language Rules
- Use "kamu" not "Anda" (unless targeting corporate LinkedIn)
- Mix Bahasa + English naturally: "Ini literally mind-blowing banget"
- Slang OK for IG/TikTok: "gue/gw", "lo", "nggak", "banget", "slay"
- LinkedIn: professional Bahasa, minimal slang
- Short punchy sentences for all platforms

### Bahasa Caption Template

```
HOOK:
[Bahasa hook — provocative question or bold claim in mixed Bahasa-English]

BODY:
[Bahasa body — keep it casual for IG/TikTok, professional for LinkedIn]
[Use Indonesian references and context]

CTA:
[Bahasa CTA — see CTA phrases table above]

HASHTAGS:
[Mix English and Bahasa hashtags]
```

### Bahasa Hook Examples

| English | Bahasa Adaptation |
|---------|------------------|
| "What Actually Happens in 1 Second" | "YANG TERJADI DALAM 1 DETIK DI BUMI" |
| "7 AI Tools You Need Right Now" | "7 TOOLS AI YANG KAMU HARUS COBA SEKARANG" |
| "This will change everything" | "INI BAKAL UBAH SEGALANYA" |
| "Stop doing this mistake" | "STOP LAKUIN KESALAHAN INI" |
| "You won't believe this" | "KAMU NGGAK BAKAL PERCAYA INI" |

## 7. Cross-Platform Caption Adaptation

When adapting the same carousel across platforms:

| From → To | Key Adjustments |
|-----------|----------------|
| IG → TikTok | More casual, shorter, add trend references, same hashtag count |
| IG → LinkedIn | More professional, add data/framework, different hashtags, add link |
| TikTok → IG | Slightly more polished, keep energy, adjust hashtags |
| TikTok → LinkedIn | Complete tone shift, add insight/framework, professional language |
| LinkedIn → IG | Simplify, add personality, visual language, emojis OK |
| LinkedIn → TikTok | Casual rewrite, Gen Z tone, trending references |

### Adaptation Checklist
- [ ] Hook fits within platform truncation point
- [ ] Tone matches platform culture
- [ ] Hashtag count matches platform rules (5/5/3-5)
- [ ] CTA uses platform-native actions (save/share vs repost)
- [ ] Character count within platform limit
- [ ] Bahasa adaptation applied (if Indonesian content)
