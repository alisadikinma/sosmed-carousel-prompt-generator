# Hook Visual Library — Expression, Lighting, Camera & Environment Specs

Single source of truth for HOW hook slides LOOK. Provides prompt-ready visual specs per hook category.

## How This File Works

**Three-file hook workflow:**
1. **hook-science.md** — Hook psychology, 5 categories, 100-hook bank, 12 Visual Action types, Topic → Hook Category mapping, scoring gate
2. **hook-formula-bank.md** — 52 fill-in-the-blank headline formula templates, 8 psychology categories
3. **THIS FILE** — Deep visual specs: expression library, lighting presets, camera angle banks, environment palettes, synergy matrix, anti-repetition system

**When generating a hook slide:**
1. Select hook category from Topic → Hook Category Mapping (hook-science.md) — **MANDATORY, never default to Visual Shock**
2. Select headline from hook bank (hook-science.md) or formula (hook-formula-bank.md)
3. Read visual profile for the selected category from THIS FILE
4. Select Visual Action from hook-science.md (Topic → Visual Action mapping)
5. Check synergy matrix (Section 7) for expression modification when combining category + visual action
6. If repeat topic this session: rotate to next variant (A→B→C) per Section 8

## Section 5: Environment Palette — 5 Hook Categories

### Visual Shock Environment

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Background | Dynamic or disrupted environment — scattered papers, tipped objects, motion blur elements, or stark minimalist void with single dramatic element |
| Color palette | High contrast warm-cool clash: warm tungsten (3200K) on subject, cool blue-teal accent in background |
| Props in frame | The visual action object (bread, coffee, ripped paper) must be prominent and lit. Background props suggest aftermath of disruption |
| Blur depth | f/1.8 with visible circular bokeh highlights, background dissolving into abstract warm-cool shapes |
| 3 depth layers | Foreground: visual action object detail / Subject: creator face with dramatic lighting / Background: disrupted environment with bokeh |
| Avoid | Calm orderly backgrounds, neutral tones, corporate settings, anything that undermines the shock |

### Negative Bias Environment

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Background | Dark minimal environment emerging from shadow — exposed brick, dark wood panel, or deep black void with subtle texture |
| Color palette | Dark warm browns and deep blacks, single warm key cutting through darkness, faint red-amber accent suggesting danger |
| Props in frame | Minimal — the warning is about the MESSAGE, not the environment. One subtle danger-signal element (red light, warning icon, harsh shadow) |
| Blur depth | f/1.8 with dark warm bokeh, background nearly black with occasional warm light leak |
| 3 depth layers | Foreground: stop-gesture hand / Subject: underlit face emerging from darkness / Background: dark void with faint warm practicals |
| Avoid | Bright cheerful backgrounds, colorful props, cluttered environments, anything that dilutes seriousness |

### Curiosity Gap Environment

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Background | Warm atmospheric space with depth and mystery — library, candle-lit room, cozy workspace with warm practicals, golden hour interior |
| Color palette | Warm ambers and deep golds (#C98B3F, #8B6914), shadows that are warm not cold, everything bathed in golden mystery light |
| Props in frame | One partially hidden or blurred object that teases the reveal — covered item, closed box, turned-away screen, shadow silhouette |
| Blur depth | f/1.8 with large warm golden bokeh orbs from practical lights, background invitingly soft |
| 3 depth layers | Foreground: hidden/teaser object partially visible / Subject: creator with knowing expression / Background: warm atmospheric space with golden bokeh |
| Avoid | Clinical bright spaces, stark minimalism, cold tones, fully revealed objects — nothing should feel completely visible |

### Relatability & Identity Environment

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Background | Authentic lifestyle setting the viewer recognizes — home desk with real clutter, cafe corner with coffee and laptop, bedroom with warm string lights, cozy couch |
| Color palette | Warm naturals: cream, soft brown, muted sage, warm wood tones, nothing too saturated or too perfect — real but elevated |
| Props in frame | Everyday recognizable objects — coffee mug, phone, laptop, headphones, notebook, plant — things the viewer owns. Not styled, naturally placed |
| Blur depth | f/2.0 with soft warm lifestyle bokeh, background readable enough to recognize the setting but not distracting |
| 3 depth layers | Foreground: lifestyle object (mug, phone) / Subject: creator in relatable posture / Background: recognizable room with warm practical lighting |
| Avoid | Studio setups, stark minimalism, luxury environments, anything that creates distance between creator and viewer |

### Speed & Value Environment

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Background | Clean professional context — organized desk with screens, bright modern workspace, or simple studio with clean backdrop |
| Color palette | Clean neutrals with professional warmth: white, light gray, warm wood, subtle accent from screens or tools. Crisp and organized |
| Props in frame | Tools of expertise visible — screens showing relevant content, books, organized supplies, the specific product/tool mentioned in hook |
| Blur depth | f/2.8 with soft professional bokeh, background clean but slightly readable showing competence signals |
| 3 depth layers | Foreground: product or hand gesture / Subject: confident creator / Background: clean professional environment with competence signals |
| Avoid | Messy environments, dark moody lighting, overly casual settings, anything that undermines professional credibility |

## Section 6: Visual Action x Expression Synergy Matrix

When combining a Visual Action (from hook-science.md) with a hook category expression (from Sections 1-2 above), the expression MODIFIES. The pose comes from the visual action; the face comes from the hook category — but they influence each other.

### Primary Synergies (Most Common Pairings)

#### Visual Shock + Destruction (primary visual action)
- **Modification:** Shock expression amplified — mouth wider, eyes more intense, caught at the exact moment of ripping/snapping
- **Pose override:** Both hands engaged in destruction action. Shock expression stays on face while body executes aggressive motion
- **Prompt phrase:** "frozen at the peak moment of aggressively ripping paper in half, torn edges suspended mid-air, eyes blown wide with visceral shock intensity, jaw dropped, the split-second between action and reaction"

#### Visual Shock + Scale Absurd (secondary)
- **Modification:** Shock redirected to amazement at scale — eyes tracking the oversized/tiny object, mouth open in "how is this real" wonder
- **Prompt phrase:** "standing next to an absurdly oversized object, eyes wide tracking upward, jaw dropped in genuine scale-shock, body leaning back as if the object just appeared"

#### Negative Bias + Minum Dramatic (primary)
- **Modification:** Warning intensity maintained during casual sip — the CONTRAST is the pattern interrupt. Serious face + casual action = "I'm so certain about this warning I can deliver it casually"
- **Prompt phrase:** "slow deliberate coffee sip with mug at lip level, steam rising past intense narrowed warning eyes, brows furrowed with grave seriousness despite the casual action, other hand pointing firmly at camera"

#### Negative Bias + Contradiction Pose (secondary)
- **Modification:** Concerned expression in mismatched emotional context — smiling environment but creator is deadly serious
- **Prompt phrase:** "surrounded by cheerful bright environment but face locked in stern warning mode, creating jarring emotional mismatch, brows drawn together, tight jaw, arms crossed protectively"

#### Curiosity Gap + Satisfying Process (primary)
- **Modification:** Knowing smirk maintained while hands perform satisfying action — the reveal IS the process. Eyes stay locked on camera with "watch this" energy
- **Prompt phrase:** "pouring honey in a slow golden stream with one hand, other hand hovering near the result, knowing smirk locked on camera, one eyebrow raised as if saying 'keep watching', warm golden backlighting catching the pour at peak moment"

#### Curiosity Gap + Makan Nyeleneh (secondary)
- **Modification:** Mysterious knowing expression while casually eating — "I know a secret and I'm making you wait while I eat"
- **Prompt phrase:** "mid-bite into bread with knowing half-smirk, cheek slightly puffed, one eyebrow raised, eyes locked on camera with amused secrecy, the deliberate casualness making the viewer desperate to know what the secret is"

#### Relatability + Wrong Context (primary)
- **Modification:** Relatable frustration/joy expression placed in absurd wrong setting — creator in pajamas at a formal event, or working from a hammock. Expression stays authentic, setting is wrong
- **Prompt phrase:** "wearing casual loungewear sitting at a formal conference table, soft relatable smile with genuine warmth in eyes, completely unbothered by the absurd context, one hand holding coffee mug, posture relaxed and comfortable despite wrong setting"

#### Relatability + Mundane Zen (secondary)
- **Modification:** Calm peer expression against chaotic background — creator is the calm center of relatable chaos
- **Prompt phrase:** "sitting cross-legged in meditation pose with soft warm smile, serene relatable expression, while background shows chaos of notification popups, scattered papers, buzzing devices — the eye of the storm of modern life"

#### Speed & Value + Props Overflow (primary)
- **Modification:** Confident authority expression while surrounded by proof — the abundance of tools/products validates the authority claim
- **Prompt phrase:** "sitting confidently at center of a cascade of relevant tools and products, chin up with direct authoritative gaze, hands confidently presenting the setup, surrounded but not overwhelmed — commanding the abundance"

#### Speed & Value + Extreme Close-Up (secondary)
- **Modification:** Authority compressed into intimate macro framing — the confidence reads even stronger at extreme proximity
- **Prompt phrase:** "extreme tight close-up of confident direct eyes and bridge of nose filling the frame, every pore visible, authoritative steady gaze unwavering, one hand visible at edge of frame holding up a number gesture"

### Synergy Rules (For Non-Primary Pairings)

When combining any visual action with any hook category not listed above:
1. **Pose/body/hands** → comes from the Visual Action prompt fragment (hook-science.md)
2. **Eyes and mouth** → comes from the hook category Expression Library (Section 1-2 above)
3. **Head position** → follows the visual action (eating = slight forward lean, drinking = chin up, destruction = aggressive forward, satisfying process = slight tilt watching the action)
4. **Emotion keyword** → combine both: "[category emotion] while [action qualifier]"
   - Example: "intense protective warning while casually mid-bite" (Negative Bias + Makan Nyeleneh)
   - Example: "genuine price-discovery amazement while holding absurd oversized product" (Unbeatable Value + Scale Absurd)
5. **Lighting** → always from the hook CATEGORY preset (Section 3), not the visual action
6. **Camera** → always from the hook CATEGORY camera bank (Section 4), not the visual action

---

## Section 7: Anti-Repetition Variation System

When generating MULTIPLE carousels for the same topic category, rotate through variant sets to ensure visual variety.

### Rotation Rules
1. First carousel on a topic → **Variant A** (default)
2. Second carousel on same topic in session → **Variant B**
3. Third carousel → **Variant C**
4. Fourth+ → cycle back to **A** but switch to **secondary Visual Action** from Topic mapping
5. If unsure which variant was used before → **always pick B** (it's the middle-ground variant most different from the expected default)

|---------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| A: Classic Mystery | MCU 85mm, slight angle | Standard 4:1 warm Rembrandt | Warm library/golden interior | Standard knowing smirk |
| B: Intimate Secret | CU 135mm, low angle | 3:1 with warm amber key only | Near-dark with candle-quality single source | Intense whisper — lips near "shush" position |
| C: Tease Reveal | MS 50mm, centered | 2:1 with bright warm key | Atmospheric room with blurred reveal object prominent | Excited anticipation — barely holding back the reveal |
