# sosmed-carousel-prompt-generator

> Cinematic AI image prompt generator for social media carousels — every frame must trigger visceral "WOW".

A Claude Code plugin that generates production-ready AI image prompts for carousel content across Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Threads. Built around a cinematography-first philosophy with psychology-based hook science: if Deakins wouldn't light it and Fincher wouldn't approve the frame, it doesn't ship.

## The Problem

| What happens | Result |
|---|---|
| Generic AI prompts produce flat, lifeless carousel images | Users scroll past |
| No consistent visual identity across slides | Brand looks amateur |
| Rebranding third-party carousels means starting from scratch | Hours wasted per carousel |
| No quality standard — every prompt is a gamble | Inconsistent feed |
| Different platform specs ignored | Wrong aspect ratios, suboptimal engagement |
| Caption writing is a separate manual step | Workflow friction, inconsistent tone |
| Factual claims in carousels go unverified | Credibility damage |
| Agent generates everything without asking | Mismatched creative decisions |

## The Solution

### 1. WOW Quality Gate (8/8 Mandatory, Min 6/8)

Every prompt is scored against 8 cinematic criteria — ALL must be present:

| # | Factor | What It Catches |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Lighting Drama | Flat, even lighting with no mood |
| 2 | Depth Layers | Missing foreground/background separation |
| 3 | Atmosphere | No haze, particles, or volumetric rays |
| 4 | Color Contrast | No warm-cool tension or accent highlights |
| 5 | Emotional Peak | Neutral, lifeless expressions |
| 6 | Camera Intention | Random angles with no purpose |
| 7 | Texture Realism | Smooth, plastic-looking surfaces |
| 8 | Cinematic Reference | No film stock or DP style anchor |

**Minimum 6/8 for ALL slide types.** Below minimum = automatic revision.

### 2. Text-in-Image Rendering

All text (headlines, accent words, branding, SWIPE CTA) is described directly in the Nano Banana Pro prompt for in-image rendering. No more separate "post-production" step — you get complete slides.

### 3. Creator Identity System

Your character reference image, brand handle, accent color, and brand icon are injected into every prompt — ensuring consistent AI-generated visuals across your entire content library. Image references produce more accurate AI likeness than text descriptions.

### 4. Auto Captions for All Platforms

Every carousel automatically generates captions for IG + TikTok + LinkedIn + Threads:

```
Single Brief → Carousel Prompts (text in-image)
                    ↓
             IG Caption (≤2200 chars, 5 hashtags)
             TikTok Title (≤19 chars, primary SEO keyword)
             TikTok Caption (≤4000 chars, 5 hashtags)
             LinkedIn Caption (≤3000 chars, 3-5 hashtags)
             Threads Caption (≤500 chars, no hashtags)
```

Default language: per `references/global-config.md` (bilingual in-image text + English captions by default).

### 5. Fact Verification

All factual claims (statistics, data, quotes) are automatically web-searched and verified before prompt generation. Sources included in output.

### 6. Interactive Slide Design

The agent detects ambiguous creative decisions and asks before generating:
- Profession-specific costumes → "Lab coat or your default blazer?"
- Setting ambiguity → "Modern glass server room or industrial gritty?"

**Note:** B-Roll with human figures automatically uses your creator face as the most prominent figure — no question needed. **Exception:** Public figure topics use the public figure's face as primary in body slides.

### 7. Psychology-Based Hook Science

5 hook categories with 100-hook bank (20 per category, Bahasa + English), backed by research data (Backlinko 912M posts, TokPortal Q2-2025, Virvid 2026, Sephora May-2025):
- **Visual Shock** — pattern interrupt in <0.5s (+131% attention retention, +400% dopamine)
- **Negative Bias** — loss aversion trigger (+63% CTR, 2:1 outperform generic)
- **Curiosity Gap** — open loop psychology (+41% retention, 70%+ completion)
- **Relatability** — identity alignment (+91.7% engagement, +31% authentic)
- **Speed & Value** — ROI on attention (2.5x saves/shares, +217% lead gen)

Plus: Gen-Z transcreation rules, interactive carousel hooks (quiz/flowchart), cover slide design specs, and algorithm engagement hierarchy.

**Hook Formula Bank (v2.11.0):** 52 fill-in-the-blank hook formula templates in 8 psychology categories (Seefluencer framework by Samuel Christ) — works for ALL content types (educational, tips, story, opinion, product, affiliate). Categories: Unbeatable Value, Problem-Solver, Plot Twist, FOMO & Urgency, Social Proof, Comparison & Authority, Hyper-Targeted, Curiosity & Teaser. Cross-mapped to the 5 visual hook categories with visual action pairing and execution checklist.

**Hook Visual Library (NEW in v2.12.0):** Deep visual specs per hook category — expression libraries with prompt-ready phrases (eyes, mouth, head, hands, body, emotion per category), lighting presets (pattern, ratio, color temp, fill, rim, shadow), camera angle banks (3 variants A/B/C per category for anti-repetition), environment palettes, Visual Action × Expression synergy matrix, and anti-repetition variation system. Mandatory hook category enforcement: agent MUST follow Topic → Hook Category Mapping, NEVER default to Visual Shock. **Costume/Wardrobe Library (v2.12.1):** 10 topic-based costume profiles with prompt-ready phrases (Finance = blazer, Tech = hoodie, Food = apron, etc.) + Default fallback. **Prop/Tool Interaction System (v2.12.1):** Topic → Prop bank (5 topic-related + 3 random absurd per category), Prop × Visual Action interaction matrix (12 actions), Hook Category → Prop selection rule (Visual Shock = absurd, others = topic-related).

### 8. CTA Science (Algorithm-Optimized)

4 CTA types ranked by engagement impact, designed around the 2026 algorithm engagement hierarchy (DM shares 3-5x > Saves 3x > Comments > Likes):

| CTA Type | Strength | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Engagement Reward** | Highest conversion (12-18%) | "Comment 'MAU' dan gue kirim guide-nya ke DM lo" |
| **Question Trigger** | Highest comment volume | "Lo termasuk yang mana? Comment angkanya!" |
| **Polarize Debate** | Highest shares + depth | "Menurut lo [A] atau [B]?" |
| **Identity Tag** | Highest DM shares | "Tag temen yang BUTUH ini" |

### 9. Subject Brand Context

When discussing a specific company (Google, WhatsApp, Tesla), their brand elements (logo, UI, color scheme) are included in the image. Without subject brand context, factual claims are meaningless to viewers.

### 10. Public Figure Face Priority (NEW in v2.10.0)

When the carousel topic is about a **public figure** (criminal, head of state, artist/celebrity, or prominent CEO), face allocation changes automatically:

| Slide Type | Whose Face? |
|---|---|
| Hook | Creator (always mandatory) — public figure as secondary element |
| Foreshadow | Creator (always mandatory) — public figure as background teaser |
| Body/Content | **Public figure is primary** — creator as optional companion beside them |
| CTA | Creator (always mandatory) — standard CTA visual rules |
| Thumbnail | Creator (always mandatory) — public figure as secondary |

The rule auto-activates when the topic names a specific public figure. No need to flag it manually.

### 11. Visual Action Hook Bank (NEW in v2.10.0)

12 absurd mundane action categories for carousel hook slides — because the best pattern interrupt is a creator doing something **nyeleneh** while delivering serious content:

| # | Category | Action Example | Best For |
|---|----------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | Makan Nyeleneh | Biting bread/apple with shocked face | Finance, Education, Tech |
| 2 | Minum Dramatic | Sipping coffee with intense stare | Business, Tutorial, Tips |
| 3 | Objek Absurd | Holding unrelated object (fish, rubber duck) dead-serious | Any serious topic |
| 4 | Destruction | Ripping paper, snapping pencil | Myth-busting, Controversy |
| 5 | Satisfying Process | Pouring honey, squeezing lemon | Food, Lifestyle, Beauty |
| 6 | Scale Absurd | Creator dwarfed by oversized prop | Tech, Comparison, Challenge |
| 7 | Wrong Context | Suit at beach, laptop in jungle | Lifestyle, Business, Travel |
| 8 | Frozen Mid-Action | Mid-jump, mid-throw freeze frame | Challenge, Motivation, Fitness |
| 9 | Extreme Close-Up | Macro shot of mouth biting, hand pouring | Universal pattern interrupt |
| 10 | Props Overflow | Buried in topic-related objects | Listicle, Tips, Education |
| 11 | Contradiction Pose | Smiling in stressful situation | Controversy, Irony, News |
| 12 | Mundane Zen | Calm meditation while background chaos | Productivity, Mental Health |

Includes Topic → Visual Action mapping, prompt-ready fragments for Nano Banana Pro, and synergy tables linking visual action to hook psychology category. The absurd mundane action IS the pattern interrupt.

### 12. Source URL Metadata Extraction (v2.6.0)

Paste an Instagram/TikTok/LinkedIn post URL and the agent auto-extracts caption, account name, engagement stats, and post date. This metadata enriches prompt context and powers caption writing — no manual copy-paste needed.

```
/carousel-prompt-generator

Agent: "Punya URL source carousel-nya?"
User:  https://instagram.com/p/DVJgCUcDAVI/

Agent extracts:
  → @getintoai (account)
  → "Another major week in AI!..." (caption)
  → 173 likes, 1 comments (engagement)
  → Feb 24, 2026 (date)

Uses caption as:
  → Topic context for image prompts
  → Skeleton for our own captions (rewritten in creator voice)
  → Factual claims → fed into verification step
  → Hashtag research reference
```

### 13. Carousel Engagement Funnel (v2.2.0)

Full-funnel engagement system from first impression to conversion:

```
HOOK (Slide 1)     → Mindblowing headline + pattern interrupt visual
    ↓                 Score 3/5 on Hook Scoring Gate before generating
FORESHADOW (Slide 2) → Bridge to body with FOMO ("kalau lo skip...")
    ↓                 4 types: Steps Tease, Fear Urgency, Quiz, Visual Tease
BODY (Slides 3-N)  → Progressive value with emotional arc
    ↓                 Mini-hook at slide 5-7 re-engages committed swipers
CTA (Last Slide)    → 4 visual types matching engagement goal
                      Polarize | Question | Identity Tag | Engagement Reward
```

### 14. Emotional Arc System (v2.2.0)

Every carousel follows a "roller coaster" emotional pattern with visual treatment mapped per beat:

| Beat | Visual Treatment |
|------|-----------------|
| HIGH (Hook) | Extreme CU, 4:1 lighting, peak saturation, pattern interrupt |
| DIP (Foreshadow) | Pull back, muted palette, tension build |
| BUILD (Body) | Progressive saturation + tighter framing |
| MINI-HOOK (Mid) | Sudden change — angle shift, color disruption |
| CLIMAX (Reveal) | Peak drama, biggest text, most shareable insight |
| WARM (CTA) | Softest lighting, warmest tone, intimate connection |

## Capabilities

### Carousel Image Prompts
Generate cinematic Nano Banana Pro prompts for each carousel slide — Hook, Content, CTA — with text rendered in-image, proper creator face placement, brand consistency, and all 8 WOW elements.

### Carousel Rebranding
Upload any third-party carousel and get it fully converted to your brand: colors, lighting, style, branding elements. No third-party logos survive.

### Thumbnail Generation
Creator face at 50-60% frame, exaggerated emotion, topic visual, text rendered in-image. Optimized for click-through.

### Caption Copywriting (Auto, All Platforms)
Captions generated by default for IG + TikTok + LinkedIn + Threads with every carousel. Platform-specific character limits, truncation-safe hooks, 2-2-1 hashtag formula, emotional triggers, CTA psychology, and TikTok triple-layer keyword SEO. Default language: English.

### Fact Verification
All factual claims (statistics, numbers, quotes) auto-verified via web search. Sources included per slide. Inaccurate claims flagged with corrections.

### Interactive Slide Design
Agent detects ambiguous slides and asks before generating — human figures (creator face or anonymous?), profession costumes, setting interpretations. Straightforward slides generated without asking.

### Indonesian Localization
Bahasa Indonesia subtitle support and localization reference. Includes setting conversions, holiday adaptations with color palettes, and AI bias countermeasures.

## Hard Rules

These are non-negotiable across all generated prompts:

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| No competitor branding | Zero competitor badges, logos, handles, or source category tags. Subject brand (Google, WhatsApp) KEPT for context |
| Brand icon + handle on every slide | Both at thirty percent opacity. Icon CENTER (above watermark). @handle CENTER (below icon). Vertical divider for comparison split-panel |
| Multi-keyword highlighting | 2-4 emotionally impactful keywords in accent color per headline — never just 1 word |
| Subtitle color | Subtitle in accent color per global-config.md (never white like main headline) |
| Creator face placement | Hook, CTA, Foreshadow, Thumbnail always. B-Roll with humans: ALWAYS (creator as most prominent). **Public figure topics**: public figure primary in body, creator as companion |
| Visual Action Hook | Hook slide MUST use absurd mundane action from Visual Action Hook Bank (12 categories) as pattern interrupt |
| Creative Clarification | Every carousel starts with 2-step clarification: 3 hook options → user picks → 3 visual combos → user picks. No auto-selection |
| Hook category enforcement | Hook category MUST match Topic → Hook Category Mapping. NEVER default to Visual Shock. Visual profile loaded from hook-visual-library.md |
| Anti-repetition | Same topic repeated = different camera variant (A/B/C) from hook-visual-library.md |
| Text rendered in-image | Headlines (MASSIVE billboard-scale, extra bold), accents, branding, SWIPE CTA — all in prompt |
| Default film stock | Per global-config.md `film_stock` (warm, not cold) |
| Aspect ratio | Platform-specific: IG Feed 4:5, TikTok 9:16, LinkedIn 4:5 |
| Image resolution | 4K via Nano Banana Pro |
| WOW minimum | 6/8, all 8 elements mandatory |
| Default language | Per global-config.md Language section (bilingual by default, single language on request) |
| Auto captions | All 4 platforms by default |
| Fact verification | All claims web-verified before output |
| SWIPE FOR MORE | "SWIPE (GESER) >" on all slides except CTA |
| Page numbers | "[N]/[TOTAL]" in top-left corner on all slides |
| Hashtags | Max 5 (IG/TikTok), 3-5 (LinkedIn) |
| Suggested filenames | SEO-optimized per slide: `{N}-{topic}-{brand}-{type}.png` |
| File output | Optional — user provides folder path at start, output saved to `{path}/carousel-prompt.md`. No path = console |

## Philosophy

### Cinematography First

Every prompt is anchored in real cinematography — named lighting setups, specific lens choices, actual film stocks, cinematographer signatures. No "make it look cinematic" hand-waving.

### Complete Slides

Text is rendered in the AI-generated image — headlines, accent words, branding, SWIPE CTA. You get a complete carousel slide, not a bare image that needs extensive post-production.

### Creator Consistency

Your face, your brand, your colors — character reference image injected into every prompt. The AI sees the same visual reference every time, producing consistent results across hundreds of slides.

### Platform-Aware

Instagram carousels, TikTok Photo Mode carousels, LinkedIn document posts — each has different specs, aspect ratios, algorithm signals, and engagement patterns. Reference docs encode platform-specific best practices so prompts and captions are optimized for where they'll actually be posted.

### Caption-Ready

Captions aren't an afterthought — they're generated by default for all 4 platforms with every carousel. Platform-specific character limits, truncation-safe hooks, and the right hashtag count.

### Verified Facts

Every factual claim is web-searched and verified before it goes into a prompt. Sources are cited. Inaccurate data is flagged and corrected.
