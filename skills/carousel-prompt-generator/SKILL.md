# Carousel Prompt Generator

Cinematic AI image prompt generator for social media carousel content.
Every frame must trigger visceral "WOW" — the reaction that stops scrolling.

## How to Use This Skill

### As Subagent (Recommended for batch work)
Copy `agents/carousel-prompt-generator.md` to your project's `.claude/agents/` directory:

```bash
# One-time setup after installing skill
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp <skill-path>/agents/carousel-prompt-generator.md .claude/agents/
cp <skill-path>/references/ ./references/ -r
```

Then invoke via Task tool:
```
Task(agent="carousel-prompt-generator", prompt="Generate carousel prompts for topic X...")
```

### As Inline Skill (For single prompts)
Claude reads this SKILL.md directly and follows the workflow below.

---

## Reference Files (Read On-Demand)

| Task | Read First |
|------|-----------|
| ANY prompt | `references/creator-bible.md` (ALWAYS) |
| Hook slide / Slide 1 | + `references/hook-science.md` (hook psychology, clickbait formulas, power words) |
| Carousel rebranding | + `references/carousel-rebranding.md` |
| Platform choice / aspect ratio | + `references/platform-specs.md` |
| Lighting/lens lookup | + `references/cinematography-lut.md` |
| Prompt templates | + `references/prompt-formulas.md` |
| Indonesian content | + `references/localization-id.md` |
| Carousel best practices | + `references/carousel-best-practices.md` |
| Caption/copywriting | + `references/caption-copywriting.md` |

---

## Creator Identity (USER-PROVIDED)

The user must supply their creator identity for personalized prompts. If not provided, ask for:

1. **Physical description** (age, gender, ethnicity, distinguishing features)
2. **Face reference image** filename (for AI face generation)
3. **Brand handle** (e.g., @username)
4. **Brand icon/logo** filename (for carousel branding)
5. **Accent color** (default: Golden Yellow #F5A623)

Use the creator description VERBATIM in every creator-facing prompt.

---

## Hard Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. NEVER competitor branding (no other creator badges, watermarks, or handles). **Subject brand** (Google, WhatsApp, etc.) that IS the topic MUST remain visible for context
2. ALWAYS include user's brand icon (top-right) + @handle watermark (CENTER of image, 30% opacity) rendered IN-IMAGE on every slide
3. Creator face on: Hook, CTA, Loop-end, Thumbnail, **AND any B-Roll with human figures** (always — no need to ask)
4. B-roll / content slides **without any human figures** = NO creator face
5. Text = **IN-IMAGE rendering** via Nano Banana Pro prompt (headlines, accents, branding, labels — all part of the prompt)
6. Accent color = user's brand color (default: Golden Yellow #F5A623)
7. Default film stock = Kodak Portra 400 (warm golden, NOT cold)
8. Aspect ratio = platform-specific. IG Feed/LinkedIn: 4:5, TikTok/Reels: 9:16 (see Platform Routing)
9. Image size = 4K via Nano Banana Pro
10. All prompts must pass WOW minimum score (6/8, all 8 elements mandatory)
11. Brand icon + @handle watermark MUST be rendered in every slide prompt
12. All factual claims MUST be web-verified before prompt generation
13. Ambiguous slides (costume/setting) MUST trigger user question before prompt generation. Human figures in B-Roll = ALWAYS creator face (no question needed)
14. Default content language = **Bahasa Indonesia** for all in-image text and captions. English or other language ONLY when user explicitly requests it
15. Captions for all 3 platforms (IG + TikTok + LinkedIn) generated by default with every carousel

---

## Default Content Language

- **In-image text** (headlines, accent words, SWIPE CTA) = **Bahasa Indonesia**
- **Captions** (hook, body, CTA, hashtags) = **Bahasa Indonesia**
- **Prompt instructions** (scene description, cinematography) = English (AI model instruction)
- Override: user says "in English" or specifies other language → switch

This is NOT a localization trigger — Bahasa is the DEFAULT. No special condition needed.

---

## Fixed Technical Specs

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Image Platform | Nano Banana Pro (exclusive) |
| Image Resolution | 4K |
| Aspect Ratio | Platform-specific (see Platform Routing) |
| Default Film Stock | Kodak Portra 400 |
| Default Grade | Warm golden amber |
| Accent Color | User-defined (default: #F5A623) |
| Primary Text | White #FFFFFF (rendered in-image) |
| Prompt Length | 80-200 words (up to 250 for complex compositions) |

---

## Fact Verification (Mandatory for Factual Content)

When a carousel contains factual claims (statistics, data, quotes, numbers):

1. **IDENTIFY** all factual claims in the brief/topic
2. **WEB-SEARCH** each claim individually
3. **VERIFY** accuracy from 2+ sources
4. **FLAG** inaccurate claims to user with corrected data
5. **INCLUDE** verified source in output

### What Counts as Factual Claim
- Statistics ("120 TB per second", "99,000 searches")
- Named entity claims ("Amazon processes X orders")
- Historical facts, dates, numbers
- Scientific claims

### What Does NOT Need Verification
- Opinions, subjective statements
- Hypothetical scenarios
- Creative/artistic descriptions
- Common knowledge ("the sun rises in the east")

---

## Interactive Slide Design — Ambiguity Detection

The agent MUST pause and ask the user when ANY of these conditions are detected in a slide:

| Trigger | Condition | Question Template |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Profession/costume** | Scene implies profession-specific clothing (lab coat, hard hat, pilot uniform) | "Slide N is set in [context]. Should you wear [profession outfit] or your default [wardrobe from creator bible]?" |
| **Setting ambiguity** | Location/environment has 2+ valid interpretations | "Slide N needs a [location type]. Which do you prefer: (A) [option] (B) [option]?" |

### Rules
- **Human figures in B-Roll = ALWAYS use creator face** (no need to ask — this is automatic)
- Creator must be the most prominent/identifiable figure (foreground, slightly closer to camera in crowd scenes)
- When NO triggers detected → generate prompt without asking
- Questions are concise, 2-3 options max, multiple-choice preferred
- Batch all questions for consecutive ambiguous slides together if possible
- After user answers, generate the prompt with their choices applied

---

## Workflow: Carousel Rebranding

1. ANALYZE source slides — extract topic, data, visual concept per slide
2. IDENTIFY third-party elements to REMOVE
3. **VERIFY** — web-search factual claims, confirm accuracy
4. **PLOT EMOTIONAL ARC** — assign emotional beat + intensity to each slide (see Emotional Arc section)
5. **INTERACTIVE** — check each slide for ambiguity triggers, ask user
6. CONVERT style to user's brand palette (warm, cinematic)
7. **SCORE HOOK HEADLINE** — verify 3/5 on Hook Scoring Gate before generating hook prompt
8. GENERATE Slide 1 (HOOK) — use Hook Slide template from `references/prompt-formulas.md`
9. GENERATE Slide 2 (FORESHADOW, mandatory) — use Foreshadow template, select type matching topic
10. GENERATE remaining slides — Nano Banana Pro prompts (text rendered in-image)
11. GENERATE last slide (CTA) — select CTA visual type matching engagement goal
12. SCORE each prompt via WOW gate (min 6/8, all 8 mandatory)
13. **GENERATE CAPTIONS** for all 3 platforms (IG + TikTok + LinkedIn)
14. VERIFY continuity checklist

## Workflow: Fresh Carousel Production

1. ANALYZE brief/topic — identify key messages, slide structure, emotions
2. **VERIFY** — web-search each factual claim, collect sources
3. DETERMINE target platform and set aspect ratio (read `references/platform-specs.md`)
4. **PLOT EMOTIONAL ARC** — assign emotional beat + intensity to each slide (see Emotional Arc section)
5. **INTERACTIVE** — check each slide for ambiguity triggers, ask user
6. **SCORE HOOK HEADLINE** — verify 3/5 on Hook Scoring Gate before generating hook prompt
7. GENERATE Slide 1 (HOOK) — use Hook Slide template from `references/prompt-formulas.md`
8. GENERATE Slide 2 (FORESHADOW, mandatory) — use Foreshadow template, select type matching topic
9. GENERATE remaining body slides — Nano Banana Pro prompts (text rendered in-image, Bahasa default)
10. GENERATE last slide (CTA) — select CTA visual type matching engagement goal
11. SCORE each prompt via WOW gate (min 6/8, all 8 mandatory)
12. **GENERATE CAPTIONS** for all 3 platforms (IG + TikTok + LinkedIn)
13. OUTPUT continuity checklist

## Workflow: Thumbnail Generation

1. READ `references/creator-bible.md` for expression + lighting setup
2. GENERATE prompt with: creator face 50-60%, exaggerated emotion, topic visual, text rendered in-image
3. SCORE WOW minimum 6/8, all 8 elements present

## Workflow: Multi-Platform Export

> **Note:** Multi-platform captions are now DEFAULT in every carousel. This workflow is for generating platform-specific SLIDE VARIATIONS (different aspect ratios per platform).

1. ANALYZE input brief/topic
2. **VERIFY** — web-search factual claims
3. READ `references/platform-specs.md` + `references/carousel-best-practices.md` + `references/caption-copywriting.md`
4. **INTERACTIVE** — check slides for ambiguity triggers
5. For EACH target platform, set:
   - Aspect ratio: IG Feed 4:5, TikTok 9:16, LinkedIn 4:5
   - Slide count: IG 7-10, TikTok 5-7, LinkedIn 5-8
   - Content tone: IG visual-first, TikTok trend-driven, LinkedIn insight-led
6. GENERATE full prompt set per platform (all slides, text in-image)
7. GENERATE caption per platform (Bahasa default)
8. SCORE each prompt via WOW gate (min 6/8)
9. VERIFY character limits: IG ≤2200, TikTok ≤4000, LinkedIn ≤3000
10. OUTPUT all variants grouped by platform
