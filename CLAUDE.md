## Key Concepts

- **Image-Only Plugin**: Nano Banana Pro is the exclusive image generation platform
- **Text-in-Image**: All text (headlines, accent words, branding, SWIPE CTA) rendered directly in the AI-generated image via prompt — NOT post-production. Font must be **MASSIVE billboard-scale, extra bold/black weight**
- **WOW Quality Gate**: 8-point scoring (lighting, depth, atmosphere, color, emotion, camera, texture, cinematic ref). **All 8 mandatory, minimum 6/8 for ALL slide types**
- **Platform-Specific Aspect Ratios**: IG Feed 4:5, TikTok/Reels 9:16, LinkedIn 4:5/1:1, Default 4:5
- **Subject Brand Context**: When discussing a specific company (Google, WhatsApp, etc.), their brand elements MUST be visible in the image for context. Without it, factual claims are meaningless
- **No Competitor Branding**: No other creator badges, watermarks, handles, or source category tags (e.g., "TECHNOLOGY" badge from source = competitor branding)
- **Creator Face Rules**: Hook/CTA/Foreshadow/Thumbnail = ALWAYS. B-Roll with human figures = ALWAYS (creator as most prominent figure). B-Roll without humans = NO face
- **Watermark**: @handle watermark **CENTER of image, 30% opacity** on all slides. For split-panel/comparison: watermark **on the vertical divider line**
- **SWIPE FOR MORE**: "GESER UNTUK LANJUT >" rendered in-image on all slides except CTA (20-30% engagement boost)
- **Gradient Zones**: Hook 40%, Foreshadow 35%, B-Roll 35%, Split-Panel 30%, CTA 40%, Thumbnail 25% (source of truth in creator-bible.md Section 7)
- **Default Language**: Bahasa Indonesia for all in-image text and captions. English only when user explicitly requests
- **Auto Captions**: Captions for all 3 platforms (IG + TikTok + LinkedIn) generated by DEFAULT with every carousel
- **Fact Verification**: All factual claims auto-verified via web search before prompt generation
- **Interactive Design**: Agent pauses + asks user at ambiguous slides (costumes, settings). Human figures = automatic creator face
- **Hook Headline Formula**: Mandatory structure `[POWER WORD] + [curiosity gap/number] + [unrevealed payoff]`. Must score 3/5 on Hook Scoring Gate BEFORE generating prompt. Power word at 120% size in accent color
- **Hook Science**: 5 psychology-based hook categories with 100-hook bank (20 per category, Bahasa + English). Hook category determines expression + scene + lighting. Includes Gen-Z transcreation rules, interactive carousel hooks (quiz/flowchart), and cover slide design specs
- **Foreshadow (Slide 2)**: MANDATORY bridge between hook and body. 4 types: Steps Tease, Fear Urgency, Quiz/Choice, Visual Tease. Creates FOMO to keep swiping. Instagram re-serves from slide 2 = second chance
- **CTA Visual Types**: 4 engagement-driven types ranked by impact: Engagement Reward (12-18% conversion), Question (highest comment volume), Polarize (highest shares + depth), Identity Tag (highest DM shares). Each has specific visual composition and lighting
- **Algorithm Engagement Hierarchy**: DM Shares (3-5x weight) > Saves (3x) > Comments (depth matters) > Dwell time > Completion rate > Likes. Optimize CTA for top signals
- **Comment-to-DM**: "Comment [WORD] and I'll DM you [resource]" = highest-converting CTA format in 2026 (12-18% with automation)
- **Emotional Arc**: Roller coaster pattern with intensity tags — HIGH (hook) → DIP (foreshadow) → BUILD (body) → MINI-HOOK (slide 5-7 surprise) → CLIMAX (reveal) → WARM (CTA). Each slide tagged with beat + intensity
- **5-Hashtag Era**: IG max 5 (Dec 2025), TikTok max 5 (Aug 2025), LinkedIn 3-5
- **Default specs**: 4K, Kodak Portra 400, warm golden amber grade, 80-200 word prompts
- **Content Language**: Single language per carousel — Bahasa Indonesia default, never bilingual mix

## Capabilities

1. **Carousel image prompts** — Nano Banana Pro, per-slide with text-in-image + WOW scoring (min 6/8)
2. **Thumbnail prompts** — creator face 50-60%, exaggerated emotion, topic visual, text in-image
3. **Carousel rebranding** — convert third-party designs to user's brand (remove competitor branding, keep subject brand)
4. **Multi-platform export** — IG + TikTok + LinkedIn with platform-specific aspect ratios
5. **Caption copywriting** — auto-generated for all 3 platforms with every carousel (Bahasa default)
6. **Fact verification** — auto-verify all claims before prompt generation
7. **Hook optimization** — mandatory headline formula + 3/5 scoring gate + category→visual matching
8. **Foreshadow system** — mandatory slide 2 bridging hook to body with FOMO
9. **CTA engagement system** — 4 visual types matching engagement goals
10. **Emotional arc plotting** — roller coaster intensity mapping across full carousel

### Creator Identity (VERBATIM Rule)
- User provides: physical description, face reference image, brand handle, brand icon, accent color
- Physical description is used **word-for-word** in every prompt
- This ensures AI model consistency across all generated content
- Template in `references/creator-bible.md`

### Carousel Engagement Funnel (Slide Structure)
| Slide | Type | Purpose | Mandatory? |
|-------|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | HOOK | Stop the scroll — mindblowing headline + pattern interrupt visual | YES |
| 2 | FORESHADOW | Bridge to body — create FOMO, "don't skip or you'll miss..." | YES |
| 3-N | BODY | Value delivery — progressive build with emotional arc | YES |
| 5-7 | MINI-HOOK | Mid-carousel surprise — re-engage committed swipers | YES (within body) |
| Last | CTA | Convert attention to action — specific visual type for engagement goal | YES |

### Creator Face Allocation
| Slide Type | Face? | Why |
|------------|-------|-----|
| Hook | Yes (always) | Exaggerated emotion matching hook category |
| Foreshadow | Yes (always) | Concerned urgency or teasing smirk |
| Content body (no humans) | No | Topic visuals only, no distraction |
| Content body (with humans) | **Yes (always)** | Creator as most prominent figure — no need to ask |
| Split-panel | Yes | Creator in both or relevant panel |
| CTA | Yes (always) | Expression matches CTA type (see 4 CTA visual types) |
| Thumbnail | Yes (always) | Curiosity gap drives clicks |

### Brand Elements In-Image
| Element | Where | Every Slide? |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Brand icon | Top-right corner | YES |
| @handle watermark | **CENTER of image** (30% opacity). On **vertical divider** for split-panel | YES |
| Headline | Bottom gradient zone — **MASSIVE billboard-scale font** | YES |
| Subject brand | In scene (logo/UI of discussed company) | When discussing specific brand |
| SWIPE CTA | Bottom center | All except CTA |

## Debugging

| Issue | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Prompt too long | Nano Banana sweet spot is 80-200 words (up to 250 complex) |
| Image resolution low | Ensure `4K` uppercase in config, not `4k` |
| Creator face inconsistent | Verify face reference filename matches across prompts |
| Wrong aspect ratio | Check platform-specs.md for platform → ratio mapping |
| Cold/blue tone | Default is Kodak Portra 400 (warm) — check color temp is 3200-3500K |
| Source branding leak | Check all slides for competitor category tags, badges, watermarks from source |
| Missing subject brand | If slide discusses Google/WhatsApp/etc., their logo/UI MUST be visible |
| Text too small | Must be MASSIVE billboard-scale, extra bold/black weight — check prompt wording |
| Text not in image | Verify prompt includes text rendering block (in-image, not post-production) |
| Watermark wrong position | Center of image (30% opacity). Vertical divider for split-panel |
| Wrong language | Default is Bahasa Indonesia — check if user requested English |
| Missing captions | Captions for all 3 platforms are default — check if user filtered |
| WOW too low | Min 6/8, all 8 elements mandatory — check each element is in prompt |
| Weak hook headline | Must score 3/5 on Hook Scoring Gate (question, number, power word, negative frame, unrevealed payoff). If < 3/5, REWRITE before generating |
| Hook visual doesn't match | Hook category determines expression + scene + lighting — check Hook Category → Visual Direction mapping in prompt-formulas.md |
| Missing foreshadow | Slide 2 MUST be foreshadow type (Steps Tease / Fear Urgency / Quiz / Visual Tease) |
| Foreshadow doesn't create FOMO | Headline must create urgency to swipe — "kalau lo skip..." / "tunggu sampai..." |
| Flat CTA | Must use specific CTA visual type (Polarize/Question/Identity Tag/Reward) — not generic creator shot. Check CTA Selection Guide in hook-science.md |
| CTA not driving engagement | Check algorithm hierarchy: DM shares (3-5x) > Saves (3x) > Comments. Engagement Reward (comment-to-DM) = highest conversion (12-18%) |
| Hook sounds formal/stiff | Must follow Gen-Z transcreation rules — gue/lo pronouns, particles (sih/tuh/banget), code-mixing. Check hook-science.md Gen-Z section |
| No emotional arc | Each slide must have emotional beat tag (HIGH/DIP/BUILD/MINI-HOOK/CLIMAX/WARM) + intensity |
| Missing mini-hook | Slide 5-7 must have sudden visual change (angle shift, split panel, color temp disruption) |
| Missing creator face in crowd | B-Roll with humans = creator ALWAYS as most prominent figure |
| Unverified facts | All factual claims must be web-searched before prompt generation |
| Cross-file drift | Run `/validate-references` — checks SWIPE, hashtags, gradients, aspect ratios |
